## About myself
I want to become a front-end developer and I think that  
 I can achieve the desired result with the help of this course.  
 I am a fast learner, sociable, have a very good logical thinking.  
 Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t have much experience in front-end development.  
 But I think soon I will improve my skills and do small projects myself
